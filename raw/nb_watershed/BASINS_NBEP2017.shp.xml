This dataset represents the drainage areas of the major rivers that flow into NBEP’s estuarine study areas. The four river basins in Narragansett Bay are defined as the area of the landscape that drains into the Taunton, Blackstone, and Pawtuxet Rivers and their tributaries as well as the drainage area for Coastal Narragansett Bay, which encompasses all land that drains directly into Narragansett Bay. The areal extents of river basins in Narragansett Bay were delineated based on grouping Watershed Planning Areas (WPAs) according to major rivers and their tributaries (for more information about the development of WPAs, see WPA_NBEP2017). River basins were not derived from the U.S. Geological Survey hierarchical system of hydrologic units, but WPA groupings were informed by MassGIS Major Watersheds (2000) and USGS HUC10 boundaries (2015). The Little Narragansett Bay and the Southwest Coastal Ponds drainage areas were not segmented further into river basins (for more information about the boundary of the Little Narragansett Bay watershed, see STUDYAREAS_NBEP2017). River basin coastlines were updated with NBEP’s estuarine coastline delineation (for details about NBEP’s coastline delineation, see metadata for BAYS_NBEP2019). This dataset is intended for use in general planning, GIS analysis, and mapping at watershed and subwatershed scales.

In Narragansett Bay Watershed, Watershed Planning Areas (WPAs) were grouped according to three major rivers and their tributaries as well as the drainage area for Coastal Narragansett Bay, which encompasses all land that drains directly into Narragansett Bay. Groupings were informed by MassGIS Major Watersheds (2000) and USGS HUC10 boundaries (2015). The Little Narragansett Bay and the Southwest Coastal Ponds drainage areas were defined as river basins for the purposes of analysis.</statement><dataSource type=""><srcDesc>The WBD represents drainage areas of the country as eight nested levels of hydrologic units. The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a seamless, national hydrologic unit dataset. Simply put, hydrologic units represent the area of the landscape that drains to a portion of the stream network. More specifically, a hydrologic unit defines the areal extent of surface water drainage to an outlet point on a dendritic stream network or to multiple outlet points where the stream network is not dendritic. A hydrologic unit may represent all or only part of the total drainage area to an outlet point so that multiple hydrologic units may be required to define the entire drainage area at a given outlet. Hydrologic unit boundaries in the WBD are determined based on topographic, hydrologic, and other relevant landscape characteristics without regard for administrative, political, or jurisdictional boundaries. The WBD seamlessly represents hydrologic units at six required and two optional hierarchical levels. The hydrologic units (HU) in the WBD form a standardized system for organizing, collecting, managing, and reporting hydrologic information for the nation. The HU in the WBD are arranged in a nested, hierarchical system with each HU in the system identified using a unique code. Hydrologic unit codes (HUC) are developed using a progressive two-digit system where each successively smaller areal unit is identified by adding two digits to the identifying code the smaller unit is nested within. WBD contains eight levels of progressive hydrologic units identified by unique 2- to 16-digit codes. The dataset is complete for the United States to the 12-digit hydrologic unit.</srcDesc><srcMedName><MedNameCd value="015"/></srcMedName><srcCitatn><resTitle>USGS WBD 2015 </resTitle><resAltTitle>The Watershed Boundary Dataset </resAltTitle><date><pubDate>2015-01-01T00:00:00</pubDate></date><otherCitDet>https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/watershed-boundary-dataset?qt-science_support_page_related_con=4#qt-science_support_page_related_con</otherCitDet><citRespParty><rpIndName>USGS</rpIndName><rpOrgName>United States Geological Survey</rpOrgName><role><RoleCd value="006"/></role><rpCntInfo><cntAddress addressType=""><eMailAdd>nhd@usgs.gov </eMailAdd></cntAddress></rpCntInfo></citRespParty></srcCitatn></dataSource><dataSource type=""><srcDesc>The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), at 1:24,000-scale or larger, represents the Nation’s rivers, streams, canals, lakes, ponds, glaciers, coastlines, dams, and stream gages, and related features. </srcDesc><srcMedName><MedNameCd value="015"/></srcMedName><srcCitatn><resTitle>USGS NHD 2015 </resTitle><resAltTitle>The National Hydrography Dataset </resAltTitle><date><pubDate>2015-01-01T00:00:00</pubDate></date><otherCitDet>https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/watershed-boundary-dataset?qt-science_support_page_related_con=4#qt-science_support_page_related_con

The objective of this statute is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters. As one step toward meeting this goal each state must administer a program to monitor and assess the quality of its surface waters and provide periodic status reports to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Congress, and the public.Section 305(b) of the CWA codifies the process whereby waters are evaluated with respect to their capacity to support designated uses as defined in the Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards. These uses include aquatic life, fish consumption, drinking water, shellfish harvesting, primary (e.g., swimming) and secondary (e.g., boating) contact-recreation, and aesthetics. The 305(b) process entails assessing each of these uses, where applicable, for rivers, lakes and coastal waters. Where possible, causes and sources of use impairment are also identified. Once a water body is identified as impaired by a pollutant, MassDEP is required under Section 303(d) of the CWA, and the implementing regulations at 40 CFR 130.7, to develop a pollutant budget designed to restore the health of the impaired water body. The process of developing this pollutant budget, generally referred to as a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL), includes identifying the cause (type of pollutant) and source (where the pollutant comes from), determining how much of the pollutant is from direct discharges (point sources) or indirect discharges (non-point sources), determining the maximum amount of the pollutant that can be discharged to a specific water body to meet water quality standards, and developing a plan to meet that goal. In short a TMDL is a clean-up plan that is required under the CWA to restore water quality and enable waters to attain designated uses. In November 2001 EPA released guidance to the states for the preparation of an optional report that would combine reporting elements of both sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the CWA. This combined report format, the Integrated List of Waters report, allows states to provide the status of all their assessed waters in a single, multi-part list. States list each waterbody or segment thereof in one of the following five categories: Category 1)Unimpaired and not threatened for all designated uses; Category 2)Unimpaired for some uses and not assessed for others; Category 3)Insufficient information to make assessments for any uses; Category 4)Impaired for one or more uses, but not requiring the calculation of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL); (impairment due to “pollution” such as low flow, habitat alterations or non-native species infestations). Category 5)Impaired for one or more uses and requiring a TMDL (impairment due to pollutant(s) such as nutrients, metals, pesticides, solids and pathogens). Waters listed in Category 5 constitute the 303(d) List. The formulation of the 303(d) List includes a more rigorous public review and comment process than does reporting under Section 305(b), and the final version of the list must be formally approved by the EPA. The remaining four categories are submitted in fulfillment of the requirements under Section 305(b), essentially replacing the old 305(b) Report format. Massachusetts formulated integrated lists in accordance with EPA guidance for the 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and, most recently, the 2012 listing cycles. The EPA subsequently approved each of these. The 2012 Integrated List of Waters (305(b)/303(d)) data layer is the spatial representation of the river, lake, and estuary segments assessed and summarized in the Massachusetts Year 2012 Integrated List of Waters report to the EPA developed pursuant to sections 305(b) (“Water Quality Inventory”) and 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act.
